# Analysis-of-UK-Local-Housing-prices-1978-2023-
Conducted an in-depth analysis of UK housing prices over a 45-year period (1978-2023) using the Local Authority Housing Statistics
(LAHS) original dataset from the UK government.
• Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values and normalizing dates for time-series analysis. Identified
Urban-rural price trends, with urban areas showing higher growth due to population and demand.
• Evaluated the impact of government housing policies, finding social housing initiatives effectively mitigated extreme prime fluctuations
in certain regions.
• Applied Regression models to analyze factors like new buildings and affordable housing, price trends, identifying a positive correlation
with urban housing prices. Created detailed visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and correlation matrices) to illustrate key
insights, including urban-rural price differences and the stabilizing effects of policy interventions.
• Generate actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and homebuyers, offering data-driven recommendations on housing
affordable ability and policy optimization.
• Utilized advanced Python tools (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) in Jupyter Notebook to conduct robust statistical and
visualization-driven analyses.
